# Development Session - 2025-09-25

## Session Overview

**Started**: 14:00  
**Branch**: `feature/ona-settings-optimization`  
**Focus**: Optimize Ona settings, documentation structure, and agent collaboration workflows

## Major Accomplishments

### Phase 1: Ona Settings Optimization (14:00-14:30)

- **Goal**: Create optimized branch for Ona settings and conventions
- **Result**: Successfully created feature branch and analyzed project structure
- **Code Changes**: Branch setup, initial analysis

### Phase 2: Documentation Restructuring (14:30-15:30)

- **Goal**: Eliminate redundancy and create AGENTS.md as Ona standard
- **Result**: Complete documentation overhaul with clear separation of concerns
- **Code Changes**:
  - Created `AGENTS.md` as central Ona guide
  - Removed `.ona-context.md` (not an Ona standard)
  - Simplified `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` with references to real code
  - Streamlined `docs/README.md` to pure file listing

### Phase 3: .tmp Directory Optimization (15:30-15:45)

- **Goal**: Create unversioned but git-maintained temporary directory
- **Result**: Simple `.tmp/` with `.gitkeep` approach
- **Code Changes**: Renamed `screenshots/` to `.tmp/`, added Ona templates

### Phase 4: Code Reference Implementation (15:45-16:15)

- **Goal**: Replace code examples with references to real implementations
- **Result**: All documentation now points to working code instead of duplicated examples
- **Code Changes**: Updated AGENTS.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, README.md with file references

### Phase 5: GitHub Optimization & Prompts (16:15-16:45)

- **Goal**: Optimize README.md for GitHub visitors and add practical Ona prompts
- **Result**: README.md now serves as entry point with development workflow and collaboration prompts
- **Code Changes**: Added session management, commit, and PR prompts

### Phase 6: Consistency & Finalization (16:45-17:00)

- **Goal**: Ensure consistency across all documentation
- **Result**: Unified session documentation workflow and proactive commit guidelines
- **Code Changes**: Added commit suggestion guidelines, discussion mode prompt

## Technical Decisions

### Decision: AGENTS.md as Single Source of Truth (15:00)

**Context**: Had both .ona-context.md and AGENTS.md with redundant content
**Decision**: Use only AGENTS.md (Ona standard) and reference real code examples
**Impact**: Eliminates maintenance overhead and follows Ona best practices

### Decision: Reference Real Code Instead of Examples (15:45)

**Context**: Documentation contained many code snippets that could become outdated
**Decision**: Point to working implementations in `src/components/`
**Impact**: Documentation stays current automatically, developers see complete context

### Decision: Simplified .tmp Directory (15:30)

**Context**: Complex git hooks and scripts for temporary directory management
**Decision**: Simple `.gitkeep` approach without automation
**Impact**: Easier maintenance, git-native solution

## Next Steps

- [ ] Test documentation with new contributors
- [ ] Consider implementing Ona commands for frequent prompts
- [ ] Monitor if real code references work better than examples
- [ ] Evaluate if session documentation template needs refinement

## Lessons Learned

- Documentation redundancy creates maintenance burden - prefer single source of truth
- Real code references are more valuable than static examples
- Following platform standards (AGENTS.md) is better than custom solutions
- Simple git-native approaches often work better than complex automation
- Clear collaboration prompts improve AI-human workflow predictability
