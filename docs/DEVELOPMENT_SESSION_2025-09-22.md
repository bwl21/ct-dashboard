# Development Session - 2025-09-22

## Session Overview

**Duration**: ~3 hours  
**Branch**: `feature/admin-table-component`  
**Focus**: Complete TagsAdmin migration to AdminTable with coordinated filtering system

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. TagsAdmin Migration to AdminTable ✅

- **Goal**: Migrate TagsAdmin from custom table implementation to AdminTable pattern
- **Result**: Successfully migrated with full feature parity
- **Code Reduction**: ~70% reduction in table-related code duplication

#### Key Changes:

- Created `useTags.ts` composable for data management
- Implemented AdminTable with custom slots for checkboxes, colors, and actions
- Maintained all original functionality (CRUD, bulk operations, search, sorting)

### 2. ChurchTools API Method Documentation ✅

- **Issue**: Runtime error `churchtoolsClient.delete is not a function`
- **Solution**: Discovered correct method is `churchtoolsClient.deleteApi()`
- **Documentation**: Added to `.ona-context.md` for future reference

#### ChurchTools Client Methods:

```typescript
churchtoolsClient.get() // GET requests
churchtoolsClient.post() // POST requests
churchtoolsClient.put() // PUT requests
churchtoolsClient.deleteApi() // DELETE requests ⚠️ NOT .delete()!
churchtoolsClient.patch() // PATCH requests
```

### 3. Coordinated Filter System Implementation ✅

- **Problem**: Three separate, uncoordinated filter mechanisms
- **Solution**: Implemented hierarchical, coordinated filtering

#### Filter Architecture:

```
1. Domain Filter (API-level)
   ↓ loads only relevant tags
2. AdminTable Search (client-level)
   ↓ filters displayed data
3. Bulk Operations
   ↓ work on (domain + search) filtered data
```

#### Technical Implementation:

- Domain filter integrated into AdminTable filters slot
- Template ref communication between AdminTable and TagsAdmin
- `filteredTagsForBulk` computed property respects all active filters
- Bulk selection logic updated to work on filtered data only

### 4. UI Consolidation ✅

- **Goal**: Reduce UI clutter and improve user experience
- **Action**: Moved bulk operations from separate card into AdminTable header
- **Result**: Reduced from 3 cards to 2 cards, cleaner interface

#### Before:

1. Header Card (stats)
2. Bulk Operations Card
3. AdminTable Card (with own header)

#### After:

1. Header Card (stats)
2. AdminTable Card (with integrated bulk operations)

### 5. Color Display Consistency Fix ✅

- **Issue**: Color circles not showing correct colors after refactoring
- **Root Cause**: Missing `getColorInfo` function lost during migration
- **Solution**: Restored function and updated color cell template

#### Color Display Features:

- Rectangular swatches (matching ColorPicker design)
- Color name + hex value display
- Proper ChurchTools color name → hex mapping
- Consistent styling across table, ColorPicker, and edit modals

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Vue Component Update Errors

**Error**: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'emitsOptions')`
**Cause**: Event-based communication with `immediate: true` watcher
**Solution**: Switched to template ref-based communication using `defineExpose`

### Challenge 2: Filter Coordination Complexity

**Problem**: Three different filter mechanisms operating independently
**Solution**: Created hierarchical filter system with clear data flow
**Key Insight**: Domain filtering at API level, search filtering at client level

### Challenge 3: AdminTable Integration Without Breaking Changes

**Constraint**: Cannot modify AdminTable to avoid affecting other components
**Solution**: Used existing `header-controls` slot for bulk operations integration

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Composable Pattern Implementation

- Extracted data management logic into `useTags.ts`
- Centralized API operations with proper error handling
- Reusable pattern for other admin components

### 2. TypeScript Integration

- Full type safety with proper interfaces
- Template ref typing for component communication
- Proper error handling with typed exceptions

### 3. Consistent Architecture

- All admin components now use AdminTable pattern
- Shared composable structure across modules
- Unified slot system for customization

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. API-Level Domain Filtering

- Reduced data transfer by loading only selected domain
- Eliminated redundant client-side domain filtering
- Improved initial load times

### 2. Efficient Bulk Operations

- Operations work on filtered datasets only
- Reduced unnecessary API calls
- Better user feedback with progress indicators

## Documentation Updates

### 1. .ona-context.md Enhancements

- Added ChurchTools API method patterns
- Documented common pitfalls and solutions
- Updated development guidelines

### 2. Code Comments

- Added inline documentation for complex filter logic
- Documented API communication patterns
- Explained template ref usage

## Commits Summary

1. **642e31b**: Complete TagsAdmin migration to AdminTable with full CRUD functionality
2. **ad20e82**: Implement coordinated filter system and integrate bulk operations into AdminTable header
3. **6a5aee5**: Restore consistent color display matching ColorPicker design

## Lessons Learned

### 1. API Method Discovery

- Always check TypeScript definitions before implementing
- Document API patterns for team knowledge sharing
- Defensive programming vs. proper API usage

### 2. Component Communication

- Template refs more reliable than events for complex scenarios
- `defineExpose` provides clean component API
- Avoid `immediate: true` watchers in component initialization

### 3. Filter System Design

- Clear separation between API-level and client-level filtering
- Hierarchical filter dependencies need explicit coordination
- User feedback essential for complex filter interactions

### 4. Refactoring Strategy

- Maintain feature parity during migrations
- Test color/styling consistency after major changes
- Preserve existing working patterns when possible

## Future Considerations

### 1. AdminTable Enhancements

- Consider making bulk operations a built-in feature
- Standardize filter coordination patterns
- Improve template ref communication patterns

### 2. Color System

- Extract color mapping to shared utility
- Consider centralizing ChurchTools color definitions
- Standardize color display components

### 3. Testing Strategy

- Add integration tests for filter coordination
- Test AdminTable slot functionality
- Validate API method usage patterns
